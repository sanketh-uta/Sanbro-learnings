-->Variable - used to store the values so that they will be stored in computer memory and can always e accessed using the variable name.
-->Rules for declaring the variables are same as in other programming languages
-->There are 7 data types in javascript
    1) string
    2) number
    3) boolean
    4) undefined --> variable declared but value not assigned (value will be undefined and also type will be undefined)
    5) null --> (type will be object but dont know why its a bug in javascript for legacy reasons)
    6) symbol
    7) BigInt
--->Types of declaring a variable   
    1)var --> This is the oldest way 
    2)let --> If there is any reassigning required we will be using this for example if we want to reassign after some computations
    3)const --> These values cant be changed throughtout

--->String concatenation with calculating values
    1)Before ES6 
        const job = 'teacher';
        const age = 27;
        console.log("I'm " + age + " years old "+job) //this will print I'm 27 years old teacher
    this was we need to keep track of using single and double quotes and even finds difficult in using spaces between string so in ES6 introduced string interpolation
    2)Now ES6 
        console.log(`I'm ${age} years old ${job}`) //this will also print the same 
---> Multiline strings
    IN ES6
        console.log(`first line
        second line
        third line`) //this will print in different lines same as we wrote in the code

--->Type Conversion and coertion
    1)Type conversion --> explicitly converting
        string to number ----> if '90' is received as strng from input now if we want to perform operations on that we need to convert to number for that Number('90')
        example--> let a = '44' to convert to number a= Number(a);
    2)Type coertion --> implicitly javascript will convert 

    Some confusing examples 
    1) console.log(1+'1') --> this will print '11'
    2) console.log('1'+1) --> this will print '11'
    3) console.log(1+2+3+'4') --> this will print '64'
    4) console.log('1'+2+3+4) --> this will print '1234'

    Suprisingly if there - * / signs even string will be converted to number implicitly using coertion
    1)console.log('10' - 5 - 1) ---> this will print 4
    2)console.log(10-'2'-1) --> this will print 7
    the same goes with * and / operators also

--->Falsy and truthy values 
    1)Falsy values --> undefined,NULL,NAN,0,''(EMPTY STRING)
    2)Truthy values --> remaining all 

---> Equality opearotrs
    1) == ---> this is loose equality that is type coertion is done and hen it checks
        example--> '3' == 3 this will be true as the string will be converted to number and then it check
    2) === --> this is strict
        example --> '3' === 3 this will be false as the type of the 2 are different

    3) != --> loose not equality
    4) !== --> strict not equality
